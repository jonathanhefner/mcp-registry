# Frequently Asked Questions

## The Registry

### What is the difference between "Official MCP Registry", "MCP Registry", "MCP registry", "MCP Registry API", etc?

- "MCP Registry API" — An API that implements the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/openapi.yaml) defined by the MCP Registry.
- "Official MCP Registry API" — The REST API served at `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`, which is a superset of the MCP Registry API. Its OpenAPI spec can be downloaded from [https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/openapi.yaml](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/openapi.yaml).
- "MCP registry" — A third-party service that provides an MCP Registry API.
- "Official MCP Registry" (or "The MCP Registry") — The service that lives at `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`.

## Publishing

### Can I delete/unpublish my server?

At time of last update, this was open for discussion in [#104](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/issues/104).

### How do I update my server metadata?

Submit a new `server.json` with a unique version string. Once published, version metadata is immutable (similar to npm).

### Can I add custom metadata when publishing?

Yes, extensions under the `x-publisher` property are preserved when publishing to the registry. This allows you to include custom metadata specific to your publishing process.

## Security & Trust

### How do I know a server is from the claimed organization?

DNS verification ensures namespace ownership. For example:

- `com.microsoft/server` requires DNS verification of microsoft.com
- `io.github.name/server` is tied to a GitHub account or GitHub organization `name`

### Is there security scanning?

The MVP delegates security scanning to:

- underlying package registries; and
- subregistries

### How is spam prevented?

- Namespace authentication requirements
- Character limits and regex validation on free-form fields
- Manual takedown of spam or malicious servers

In future we might explore:

- Stricter rate limiting (e.g., 10 new servers per user per day)
- Potential AI-based spam detection
- Community reporting and admin blacklisting capabilities

## API & Integration

### Can I extend the registry API?

Yes, we support `x-com.example` style extensions in a bunch of places - see the official MCP registry API spec. This can be used to add annotations to many objects, e.g. add security scanning details, enrich package metadata, etc.

If you have a use case that can't be addressed here, raise a GitHub issue!

### Can I use the code here to run my own registry instance?

The registry implementation here is not designed for self-hosting, but you're welcome to try to use it/fork it as necessary. Note that this is not an intended use, and the registry maintainers cannot provide any support for this at this time.

## Operations & Maintenance

### What if I need to report a spam or malicious server?

1. Report it as abuse to the underlying package registry (e.g. NPM, PyPi, DockerHub, etc.); and
2. Raise a GitHub issue on the registry repo with a title beginning `Abuse report: `

### What if I need to report a security vulnerability in the registry itself?

Follow [the MCP community SECURITY.md](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
